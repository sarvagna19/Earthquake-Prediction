# Earthquake-Prediction
Predictive Analytics on forecasting the magnitude of earthquakes

To mine space time earthquake patterns from un-observable dynamics using data mining techniques, 
artificial neural networks and predict the magnitude  and occurrence of the earthquakes.


Assumption – All regional factors are filtered out and the general information about the 
earthquake precursory patterns can be 	extracted
